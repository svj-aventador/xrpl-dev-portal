# Escrow

Escrow is a feature of the RCP Ledger that allows you to send conditional RCP payments. These conditional payments, called _escrows_, set aside RCP and deliver it later when certain conditions are met. Conditions to successfully finish an escrow include time-based unlocks and [crypto-conditions][]. Escrows can also be set to expire if not finished in time.

The RCP set aside in an escrow is locked up. No one can use or destroy the RCP until the escrow has been successfully finished or canceled. Before the expiration time, only the intended receiver can get the RCP. After the expiration time, the RCP can only be returned to the sender.

**Step 1:** To send an escrow, the sender uses an [EscrowCreate transaction][] to lock up some RCP. This transaction defines a finish time, an expiration time, or both. The transaction may also define a crypto-condition that must be fulfilled to finish the escrow. This transaction must define an intended recipient for the RCP; the recipient _may_ be the same as the sender.

**Step 2:** After this transaction has been processed, the RCP Ledger has an [Escrow object](escrow-object.html) that holds the escrowed RCP. This object contains the properties of the escrow as defined by the transaction that created it. If this escrow has a finish time, no one can access the RCP before then.

**Step 3:** The recipient, or any other RCP Ledger address, sends an [EscrowFinish transaction][] to deliver the RCP. If the correct conditions are met, this destroys the Escrow object in the ledger and credits the RCP to the intended recipient. If the escrow has a crypto-condition, this transaction must include a fulfillment for that condition. If the escrow has an expiration time that has already passed, the EscrowFinish transaction instead fails with the code [`tecNO_PERMISSION`](tec-codes.html).

### Expiration Case

[![Escrow Flow Diagram (Expired escrow)](img/escrow-cancel-flow.png)](img/escrow-cancel-flow.png)

All escrows start the same way, so **Steps 1 and 2** are the same as in the successful case.

**Step 3a:** If the escrow has an expiration time, and it has not been successfully finished before then, the escrow is considered expired. It continues to exist in the RCP Ledger, but can no longer successfully finish. (Expired objects remain in the ledger until a transaction modifies them. Time-based triggers cannot change the ledger contents.)

**Step 4a:** The sender, or any other RCP Ledger address, sends an [EscrowCancel transaction][] to cancel the expired escrow. This destroys the [Escrow object](escrow-object.html) in the ledger and returns the RCP to the sender.

## Limitations

Escrow is designed as a feature to enable the RCP Ledger to be used in the [Interledger Protocol][] and with other smart contracts. The current version has a modest scope to avoid complexity.

- Escrow only works with RCP, not issued currencies.
- Escrow requires sending at least two transactions: one to create the escrow, and one to finish or cancel it. Thus, it may not be financially sensible to escrow payments for very small amounts, because the participants must destroy the [transaction cost](transaction-cost.html) of the two transactions.
    - When using Crypto-Conditions, the [cost of the transaction to finish the escrow](#escrowfinish-transaction-cost) is higher than usual.
- All escrows must be created with a "finish-after" time or a [crypto-condition][], or both. If the escrow does not have a finish-after time, it must have an expiration time.

    **Note:** The [fix1571 amendment][] changed the requirements for creating an escrow. Escrows created before that amendment could provide an expiration time with no condition or finish-after time. Anyone can finish such escrows immediately (sending the funds to the intended recipient).

- None of the time values can be in the past when the escrow-creating transaction executes.
- Timed releases and expirations are limited to the resolution of RCP Ledger closes. This means that, in practice, times may be rounded to approximately 5 second intervals, depending on exactly when the ledgers close.
- The only supported [crypto-condition][] type is PREIMAGE-SHA-256.

Escrow provides strong guarantees that are best suited for high-value, low-quantity payments. [Payment Channels](use-payment-channels.html) are better suited for fast, low-value payments. Of course, unconditional [Payments](payment.html) are also preferable for many use cases.

## State Diagram

The following diagram shows the states an Escrow can progress through:

[![State diagram showing escrows going from Held → Ready/Conditionally Ready → Expired](img/escrow-states.png)](img/escrow-states.png)

The diagram shows three different cases for three possible combinations of the escrow's "finish-after" time (`FinishAfter` field), crypto-condition (`Condition` field), and expiration time (`CancelAfter` field):

- **Time-based Escrow (left):** With only a finish-after time, the escrow is created in the **Held** state. After the specified time has passed, it becomes **Ready** and anyone can finish it. If the escrow has an expiration time and no one finishes it before that time passes, then the escrow becomes **Expired**. In the expired state, an escrow cannot be finished, and anyone can cancel it. If the escrow does not have a `CancelAfter` field, it never expires and cannot be canceled.

- **Combination Escrow (center):** If the escrow specifies both a crypto-condition (`Condition` field) _and_ a "finish-after" time (`FinishAfter` field), the escrow is **Held** until its finish-after time has passed. Then it becomes **Conditionally Ready**, and can finish it if they supply the correct fulfillment to the crypto-condition. If the escrow has an expiration time (`CancelAfter` field), and no one finishes it before that time passes, then the escrow becomes **Expired**. In the expired state, an escrow cannot be finished, and anyone can cancel it. If the escrow does not have a `CancelAfter` field, it never expires and cannot be canceled.

- **Conditional Escrow (right):** If the escrow specifies a crypto-condition (`Condition` field) and not a finish-after time, the escrow becomes **Conditionally Ready** immediately when it is created. During this time, anyone can finish the escrow, but only if they supply the correct fulfillment to the crypto-condition. If no one finishes the escrow before its expiration time (`CancelAfter` field), the escrow becomes **Expired**. (An escrow without a finish-after time _must_ have an expiration time.) In the expired state, the escrow can no longer be finished, and anyone can cancel it.



## Availability of Escrow

Conditional payments have been enabled by the ["Escrow" Amendment](known-amendments.html#escrow) to the RCP Ledger Consensus Protocol since 2017-03-31. A previous version of the same functionality was available on the [RCP Ledger Test Net](xrp-test-net-faucet.html) by the name "Suspended Payments" (SusPay) in 2016.

When testing in [stand-alone mode](rippled-server-modes.html#reasons-to-run-a-rippled-server-in-stand-alone-mode), you can force the Escrow feature to be enabled locally regardless of the amendment status. Add the following stanza to your `rippled.cfg`:

    [features]
    Escrow

You can check the status of the Escrow amendment using the [feature method][].

## EscrowFinish Transaction Cost

When using [crypto-conditions][], the EscrowFinish transaction must pay a [higher transaction cost](transaction-cost.html#special-transaction-costs) because of the higher processing load involved in verifying the crypto-condition fulfillment.

If the escrow is purely time-locked with no crypto-condition, the EscrowFinish costs only the standard [transaction cost](transaction-cost.html) for a reference transaction.

The additional transaction cost required is proportional to the size of the fulfillment. Currently, an EscrowFinish with a fulfillment requires a minimum transaction cost of **330 [drops of RCP](basic-data-types.html#specifying-currency-amounts) plus 10 drops per 16 bytes in the size of the fulfillment**. If the transaction is [multi-signed](multi-signing.html), the cost of multi-signing is added to the cost of the fulfillment.

**Note:** The above formula is based on the assumption that the reference cost of a transaction is 10 drops of RCP.

If [Fee Voting](fee-voting.html) changes the `reference_fee` value, the formula scales based on the new reference cost. The generalized formula for an EscrowFinish transaction with a fulfillment is as follows:

```
reference_fee * (signer_count + 33 + (fulfillment_bytes / 16))
```


## Why Escrow?

The age-old practice of [Escrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow) enables many kinds of financial transactions that would be considered risky otherwise, especially online. By letting a trusted third party hold the money while a transaction or evaluation period is underway, both sides can be assured that the other must hold up their end of the bargain.

The Escrow feature takes this idea further by replacing the third party with an automated system built into the RCP Ledger, so that the lock up and release of funds is impartial and can be automated.

Fully automated escrow, backed by the integrity of the RCP Ledger itself, solves important problems for Ripple, and we think there are many other use cases that escrow enables. Ripple encourages the industry to find new and unique ways to put escrow to use.

### Use Case: Time-based Lockup

**Background:** Ripple holds a large amount of the total RCP, which it sells methodically as a way to fund and incentivize the healthy development of the RCP Ledger and related technologies. At the same time, owning such a large chunk of RCP causes problems for the company, such as:

- Individuals and businesses who use the RCP Ledger worry that their investments in RCP could be diluted or devalued if Ripple were to flood the market by selling at a higher rate than usual.
    - Although flooding the market would be a long-term loss for Ripple, the possibility that the company could do so exerts downward pressure over the price of RCP, and thus decreases the value of the company's assets.
- Ripple must carefully manage ownership of its accounts to protect against digital theft and other forms of malicious behavior, even by insiders.

**Solution:** By placing 55 billion RCP into time-based escrows, Ripple ensures that the supply of RCP in circulation is predictable and increases at a slow but steady rate. Others who hold RCP know that Ripple cannot flood the market, even if the company's priorities or strategy changes.

Placing the money into escrow does not directly protect Ripple's holdings from malicious actors, but it sharply reduces the amount of RCP that can be quickly stolen or redirected if a malicious actor gains temporary control over Ripple's RCP accounts. This reduces the risk of catastrophic losses of RCP and increases the time for Ripple to detect, prevent, and track down unintended uses of Ripple's RCP assets.

### Use Case: Interledger Payments

**Background:** In the quickly-developing world of financial technology, one of the core challenges is coordinating activities that cross multiple digital money systems, or ledgers. Many proposed solutions to this problem (including early views of the RCP Ledger!) can be reduced to creating "one ledger to rule them all." Ripple believes no single system can meet the needs of everyone in the world: in fact, some desirable features are mutually exclusive. Instead, Ripple believes that an interconnected network of ledgers—an _interledger_—is the true future of financial technology. The [Interledger Protocol][] defines standards for making as many systems as possible connect securely and smoothly.

The most fundamental principle of inter-ledger payments is _conditional transfers_. Multi-hop payments have a risk problem: the more hops in the middle, the more places the payment can fail. Interledger solves this with the financial equivalent of a "[two-phase commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol)", where the two steps are (1) prepare conditional transfers, then (2) fulfill the conditions to execute the transfers. The Interledger project defined a [crypto-conditions][] specification to standardize automated ways to define and verify conditions, and settled on SHA-256 hashes as a "common denominator" of such conditions.

**Solution:** The Escrow feature makes the RCP Ledger ideal for bridging multi-hop payments using the Interledger Protocol, because it natively supports transfers that deliver RCP based on PREIMAGE-SHA-256 crypto-conditions, and it executes those transfers within seconds of being presented with the matching fulfillment.
