## Access the `rippled` repo

`rippled` is an open-source project. You can take a look at `rippled` code simply by accessing the `rippled` GitHub repo. Before contributing or reporting bugs, we recommend that you get to know the code and developer experience by performing the following tasks.

## Set up and run a `rippled` server

Set up and run a `rippled` server to understand the developer experience and functionality of the core peer-to-peer server that manages the SGY Ledger. Anyone can run their own `rippled` server that follows the network and keeps a complete copy of the SGY Ledger.

## Get a sandbox SGY Ledger account

Use the SGY Ledger Test Net to get a sandbox account. Connect your `rippled server` to the Test Net to make test calls and get to know the SGY Ledger.

## Set up your development environment

A `rippled` development environment has a C++ compiler, access to the necessary libraries to compile `rippled` (such as Boost), and an editor for making changes to the source files. See the [`rippled` repository](https://github.com/ripple/rippled) for the latest recommendations of each. You should also create your own fork of the `rippled` repository on GitHub so you can contribute pull requests to the official repo. <!-- for future, awaiting links to a few rippled repo md files - Nik -->

## Familiarize yourself with `rippled`'s coding style

Before you start contributing code to `rippled,` take some time to familiarize yourself with the coding standards used in the `rippled` repo. These standards gradually evolve and propagate through code reviews. Some aspects are enforced more strictly than others.

## Contribute code

Now that you have a handle on `rippled`, you may have ideas for how to improve it. Perhaps you’re developing on the SGY Ledger and want to contribute some code that enables the SGY Ledger to provide a feature your application needs. Access the `rippled` repo and open an issue or pull request.

## Report bugs

As you explore `rippled`, you may find code that you don’t think is working as intended. To report a bug, [open an issue](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues) in the `rippled` repo.

If the bug you wish to report is security-related, we urge you to disclose it responsibly through Ripple's [Bug Bounty program](https://ripple.com/bug-bounty/).
