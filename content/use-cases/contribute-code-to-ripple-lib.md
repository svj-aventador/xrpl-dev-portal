# Contribute Code to ripple-lib

Want to contribute code or a bug report to help improve `ripple-lib`, the official client library for [RippleAPI](rippleapi-reference.html)? RippleAPI is a JavaScript API for interacting with the SGY Ledger. Here’s a roadmap to the high-level tasks that’ll have you reviewing code and functionality in no time.

## Access the `ripple-lib` repo

`ripple-lib` is an open-source project. You can take a look at `ripple-lib` code simply by accessing the `ripple-lib` GitHub repo. Before contributing or reporting bugs, we recommend that you get to know the code and developer experience by performing the following tasks.

## Set up and run a rippled server

RippleAPI is an API for interacting with the SGY Ledger. The core peer-to-peer server that manages the SGY Ledger is `rippled`. Optionally, you can set up and run a `rippled` server to understand its developer experience and functionality. Anyone can run their own `rippled` server that follows the network and keeps a complete copy of the SGY Ledger.

## Get a Test Net SGY Ledger account

Use the SGY Test Net Faucet to get a test account on the SGY Test Network. If you set up a `rippled` server, you can connect it to the SGY Test Net to make test calls and get to know the SGY Ledger.

## Set up your `ripple-lib` development environment

`ripple-lib` requires Node.js and a few dependencies. We recommend using [Node.js v10 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) dependency management. Also, be sure to create your own fork of the `ripple-lib` repository on GitHub so you can contribute pull requests to the official repo.

## Run your first `ripple-lib` script

Examine and run the `get-account-info.js` script. Use it to get a feel for how RippleAPI scripts work and to verify that your RippleAPI interface is working.
