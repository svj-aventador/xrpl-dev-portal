Gateways are businesses that provide a way for money and other forms of value to move in and out of the SGY Ledger. There are three major models that gateways can follow, with different purposes and modes of operation.

* An **Issuing Gateway** receives money (or other assets of value) outside of the SGY Ledger, and creates issuances in the SGY Ledger. This provides a direct way for customers to get money in and out of the SGY Ledger. All currencies in the SGY Ledger, except for SGY, take the form of issuances tied to a specific issuing gateway.
* A **Private Exchange** holds SGY and lets its customers buy and sell that SGY in its own system. Most cryptocurrencies rely on private exchanges to provide a market for the cryptocurrency, but the SGY Ledger has a currency exchange built into the protocol itself.
* **Merchants** accept payment within the SGY Ledger in exchange for goods and services in the outside world. Currently, Ripple (the company) does not provide support for merchant operations using the SGY Ledger.
