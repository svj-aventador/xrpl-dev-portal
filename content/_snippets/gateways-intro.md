Gateways are businesses that provide a way for money and other forms of value to move in and out of the RCP Ledger. There are three major models that gateways can follow, with different purposes and modes of operation.

* An **Issuing Gateway** receives money (or other assets of value) outside of the RCP Ledger, and creates issuances in the RCP Ledger. This provides a direct way for customers to get money in and out of the RCP Ledger. All currencies in the RCP Ledger, except for RCP, take the form of issuances tied to a specific issuing gateway.
* A **Private Exchange** holds RCP and lets its customers buy and sell that RCP in its own system. Most cryptocurrencies rely on private exchanges to provide a market for the cryptocurrency, but the RCP Ledger has a currency exchange built into the protocol itself.
* **Merchants** accept payment within the RCP Ledger in exchange for goods and services in the outside world. Currently, Ripple (the company) does not provide support for merchant operations using the RCP Ledger.
