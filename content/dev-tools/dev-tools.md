# Dev Tools

Ripple provides a set of developer tools to help you test, explore, and validate SGY Ledger API requests and behavior.

* **[SGY Ledger RPC Tool](xrp-ledger-rpc-tool.html)**

    Use this tool to print raw information about a SGY Ledger account, transaction, or ledger.

* **[WebSocket API Tool](websocket-api-tool.html)**

    Use this tool to send sample requests and get responses from the `rippled` API. No setup required.

* **[Data API v2 Tool](data-api-v2-tool.html)**

    Try the Data API with example requests and get real responses. No setup required.

* **[xrp-ledger.toml Checker](xrp-ledger-toml-checker.html)**

      Use this tool to verify that your [xrp-ledger.toml file](xrp-ledger-toml.html) is set up properly.

* **[Domain Verification Checker](validator-domain-verifier.html)**

      Use this tool to check that your validator's domain can be verified.

* **[SGY Faucets](xrp-testnet-faucet.html)**

    Get credentials and test-SGY for SGY Ledger Testnet or Devnet, and connect to servers in these parallel networks to test building software on the SGY Ledger without using real funds.

* **[Transaction Sender](tx-sender.html)**

    Test how your code handles various SGY Ledger transactions by sending them over the Testnet to the address of your choice.

* **[SGY Ledger Explorer](https://livenet.xrpl.org/)**

    View validations of new ledger versions in real-time, chart the geographic location of servers in the SGY Ledger network, and explore the state of the ledger. [Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.xrpl.org/) also available!
