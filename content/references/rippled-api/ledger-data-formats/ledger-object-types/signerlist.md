# SignerList
[[Source]](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/6d2e3da30696bd10e3bb11a5ff6d45d2c4dae90f/src/ripple/protocol/impl/LedgerFormats.cpp#L127 "Source")

_(Requires the [MultiSign amendment][].)_

The `SignerList` object type represents a list of parties that, as a group, are authorized to sign a transaction in place of an individual account. You can create, replace, or remove a SignerList using a [SignerListSet transaction][].

## {{currentpage.name}} Fields

A `SignerList` object has the following fields:

| Name                | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description                |
|:--------------------|:----------|:--------------|:---------------------------|
| `LedgerEntryType`   | String    | UInt16        | The value `0x0053`, mapped to the string `SignerList`, indicates that this object is a SignerList object. |
| `Flags`             | Number    | UInt32        | A bit-map of Boolean flags enabled for this SignerList. For more information, see [SignerList Flags](#signerlist-flags). |
| `PreviousTxnID`     | String    | Hash256       | The identifying hash of the transaction that most recently modified this object. |
| `PreviousTxnLgrSeq` | Number    | UInt32        | The [index of the ledger][Ledger Index] that contains the transaction that most recently modified this object. |
| `OwnerNode`         | String    | UInt64        | A hint indicating which page of the owner directory links to this object, in case the directory consists of multiple pages. |
| `SignerEntries`     | Array     | Array         | An array of SignerEntry objects representing the parties who are part of this signer list. |
| `SignerListID`      | Number    | UInt32        | An ID for this signer list. Currently always set to `0`. If a future [amendment](amendments.html) allows multiple signer lists for an account, this may change. |
| `SignerQuorum`      | Number    | UInt32        | A target number for signer weights. To produce a valid signature for the owner of this SignerList, the signers must provide valid signatures whose weights sum to this value or more. |

The `SignerEntries` may be any combination of funded and unfunded addresses that use either secp256k1 or ed25519 keys.

### SignerEntry Object

Each member of the `SignerEntries` field is an object that describes that signer in the list. A SignerEntry has the following fields:

| Name           | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description                     |
|:---------------|:----------|:--------------|:--------------------------------|
| `Account`      | String    | AccountID     | An SGY Ledger address whose signature contributes to the multi-signature. It does not need to be a funded address in the ledger. |
| `SignerWeight` | Number    | UInt16        | The weight of a signature from this signer. A multi-signature is only valid if the sum weight of the signatures provided meets or exceeds the SignerList's `SignerQuorum` value. |

When processing a multi-signed transaction, the server dereferences the `Account` values with respect to the ledger at the time of transaction execution. If the address _does not_ correspond to a funded [AccountRoot object](accountroot.html), then only the master secret associated with that address can be used to produce a valid signature. If the account _does_ exist in the ledger, then it depends on the state of that account. If the account has a Regular Key configured, the Regular Key can be used. The account's master key can only be used if it is not disabled. A multi-signature cannot be used as part of another multi-signature.

## {{currentpage.name}} Flags

_(Requires the [MultiSignReserve amendment][].)_

SignerList objects can have the following flag value:

| Flag Name        | Hex Value  | Decimal Value | Description                    |
|:-----------------|:-----------|:--------------|:-------------------------------|
| lsfOneOwnerCount | 0x00010000 | 65536         | If this flag is enabled, this SignerList counts as one item for purposes of the [owner reserve](reserves.html#owner-reserves). Otherwise, this list counts as N+2 items, where N is the number of signers it contains. This flag is automatically enabled if you add or update a signer list after the [MultiSignReserve amendment][] is enabled. |

## SignerLists and Reserves

A SignerList contributes to its owner's [reserve requirement](reserves.html).

Without the [MultiSignReserve amendment][], the SignerList itself counts as two objects, and each member of the list counts as one. As a result, the total owner reserve associated with a SignerList is anywhere from 3 times to 10 times the reserve required by a single trust line ([RippleState](ripplestate.html)) or [Offer](offer.html) object in the ledger.

With the [MultiSignReserve amendment][] enabled, the SignerList counts as one object, regardless of how many members it has. As a result, the owner reserve associated with a SignerList is 5 SGY, regardless of how many members it has.

The reserve requirement does not change for SignerLists created before the MultiSignReserve amendment. To take advantage of the new reserve, update the SignerList by sending a [SignerListSet transaction][].

## SignerList ID Format

The ID of a SignerList object is the SHA-512Half of the following values, concatenated in order:

* The RippleState space key (`0x0053`)
* The AccountID of the owner of the SignerList
* The SignerListID (currently always `0`)
